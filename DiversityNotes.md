# Diversity Lessons from Lesbians Who Tech Conference

Notes on what other companies are doing around diversity.

## Summary
* Diversity is hard, no one has really got it right yet
* Lots of large companies have spent a lot of money on trying to improve diversity and just spending lots of money doesn't seem to have been the solution
* Unsurprisingly at this conference a lot of the focus was on LGBT+ people but I think most of the actions and advice can be generalised
* It is a mistake to just focus on one 'group' at a time
* It's not enough to just recruit people you need to keep them as well

## Recruitment

You should be vocal in promoting diversity work being done and diversity groups within a company. This is something that potential employees from underrepresented groups are likely to look out for when they are assessing if they want to work for you. In the US some companies focus a lot on getting a [Human Rights Campaign Rating](http://assets.hrc.org//files/assets/resources/CEI-2017-FinalReport.pdf?_ga=1.120420296.1514129384.1488043663) of 100%.

[include.io](https://include.io/), a recruitment platform, was launched at Lesbians who Tech. This 10 minute [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcAbPYwwoio) on it explains its purpose. The goal is to extend the referrals model of recruitment. People sign up and upload coding projects. They then are mentored for half an hour and the mentor can choose to recommend them. Companies can then use it for recruitment and if they want they can filter by recommendations only from people in their company. This has only just launched and I suspect it may be quite US centric at least to begin with.

Megan Rose Dickey gave an interesting talk based on [this article](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/31/the-other-pipeline/) on how wider social issues can cause the lack of diversity in tech.

### Recruitment mistakes:

1. Only hiring from your own networks
2. Not hiring people with non traditional coding backgrounds e.g. people who learnt to code at bootcamps.

### What are other companies doing?

#### August Inc. - Talk from Krys Burnette.

They were really honest early on about the fact that they had a diversity problem and that hiring from your networks doesn’t solve diversity. Acknowledged it really early on in the company's creation and didn’t have a lot of money to throw at the problem unlike a lot of big tech companies.

##### Case Study:
Sponsored the podcast [Another Round](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/another-round) and compared people who came through general enquiries vs people who heard about them through the podcast advert. All candidates interviewed were given an anonymous survey with 8 open ended questions.

They have some really good resources that they have made [publicly available](http://public.aug.co/drive)

[Summary Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1slZdoTYi8dHV5EU84aorV9AaA_xxrVq8QGzNdhkWXo4/) of the work August Inc. has done.

Advice:
* Tapping into your networks doesn’t work, you will get people like you
* Use twitter to find people not like you and use this to find places to reach out to when advertising jobs.
* Don’t assume you have a diverse team, always be on the lookout for people not like you
* Sponsor podcasts that inspire you
* Sponsor spaces that are not ‘conventional tech spaces’
* It’s not enough to recruit people you also need to keep them
* They use [textio](https://textio.com/) on job descriptions

#### AirBnB - Talk from Elena Grewel
Hiring in tech is challenging as you are always trying to hire quickly so you often use your networks to do so. At Airbnb they studied the gender breakdown at application level and interview level.

##### Improving diversity of applicants
Worked to build an external community to show that AirBnB is open to diversity. This included:
* Giving lightning talks
* Writing blog posts
* Hosting Women in Tech lunches

##### Improving diversity through the application process

There are 4 parts to the interview:

1. Application
2. Take home test
3. Onsite interview
4. Hiring

In theory the gender split should be the same at each level but it wasn't. They found that there was not a standard criteria of assessment. Also the people doing interviewing were not very diverse.

## External diversity
### Corporations Advancing LGBT Rights - Talk From Kimberley Messer

Focusing on multinational companies and the actions they should take when working in countries that are not very good on LGBT+ rights. Talked about [Out in the World: Securing LGBT Rights in the Global Marketplace](http://www.talentinnovation.org/publication.cfm?publication=1510) (you have to pay for the report). In this report there's a lot of focus on the importance of being good on LGBT rights because it's good for business.

Suggestions:

* Work with local NGOs so that you have organisations on the ground that can help you be effective.
* Hold yourself to a higher standard than just doing the bare minimum required by local laws. E.G. Same benefits for same sex couples even if it is not required by law.

## Internal diversity

### Employee Resource Groups (ERG)

I'd not heard of [ERGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_resource_groups) before but they were discussed a lot. I think it’s pretty US specific, they seem to be common in larger companies as is having an employee dedicated to managing these groups and allocating funding. A lot of tech companies are in a position to dedicate a lot of money to diversity but it hasn't been enough to 'fix diversity'. A common theme in the conference was intersectionality and having resource groups for various under represented groups work together.

In smaller companies that I spoke to diversity groups have formed organically but the employees spoke about the importance of support from management and acknowledgement that the work being done is valuable. Need to have visibility and support from the top levels.

#### Group Communication

Slack channels - a more public one for LGBT+ people and allies and a more private one that is invite only. I talked a lot to people about how you include people who might not want to be out a work but might still want to be part of the support network. No one really seems to have solved this.

### Working on Diversity Initiatives

I heard a lot of people refer to their 'gay job' and their 'regular job' and the challenges of balancing the two. I think this could be applied to any type of diversity being worked on. There was a panel managing diversity work alongside your regular work the main points were:

* The importance of making sure that diversity work is spread across multiple people
* Having a strong support network
* Importance of not making it the responsibility of minority groups to solve the 'diversity problem' in tech.

### How to improve work culture for trans women - Talk from Hazel Havard

It is important to be explicitly inclusive of trans women. For example specifying that women’s events are open to trans women.

#### Five Practical Steps
Don’t wait until you have a trans employee to do this

1. Be an awesome ally:
  * Listen to the community
  * Amplify trans voices
  
2. Implement policies and training:
  * Be explicit in your codes of conduct
  * Have regular and explicit employee training
  * Don’t wait until you mess up to do this
  
3. Have inclusive bathrooms - Gender Neutral options

4. Have inclusive benefits
  * E.g. covering medical costs specific to being trans on health insurance
  
5. Facilitate Organisational Change
  * Don’t just be all talk and promises you should only talk about what you’ve done and what you’re working on.
  * You should set dates when you plan to do something by and how you’re going to escalate it if you haven’t achieved it by then
